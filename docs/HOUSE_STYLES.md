# House style traits (HS-*)

Each HS-* task names a short, checkable trait list for one house style, measures
it with `qa/house_trait_measure.gd` (`HouseTraitMeasure.measure`, extend it with
the keys the next style needs) in a focused test with negative controls, and
then has an independent reviewer tick it on renders.

## cottage (HS-COTTAGE)

Traits: (1) one storey, eave wall top <= 2.6 m; (2) exactly one masonry stack on
the hearth wall, rising above the ridge; (3) a porch roof over the front door.

Measured first: traits 1 and 2 already held on 40 seeds (stack present, on the
hearth wall, above the ridge). Trait 3 failed on about half of them because the
style row drew `porch` at 0.5. Fix: `porch` and `chimney` are 1.0 in the
`cottage` row of `HouseSpec.STYLES` (`chance` still consumes its draw, so the
random stream and every other roll are unchanged). A request that asks for more
than one storey is the caller's choice and is not clamped.

Test: `tests/house_cottage_traits_test.gd` (28 checks) over the frozen requests
`house/cottage/{1,8102,21325}` in `tests/fixtures/family_style_requests.json`;
controls: two storeys, chimney removed, porch removed.

Renders for review: `artifacts/goal/HS-COTTAGE/renders/` (`tools/render_hs_cottage.gd`,
not headless).

Reviewer tick (roof-on three-quarter + interior eye-level): OPEN, pending an
independent reviewer. No trait is ticked here by the implementing agent.
